what needs to get done for this project to be finished: 

when the user goes to the home page, he should be able to click on a link to go to an events page.
 
There, he should see the packages that they offer for birthdays as well as the different features and attractions of the park. He should be able to choose a package for his birthday.
	
	the packages should be displayed on the events page. For example, for the coming week, the packages available are birthday and super_birthday 
	Or, the user chooses June 25th, and he chooses the super_birthday package. 
	First you choose the package you want, then you choose the date 




When he does this, he should be able to add this event to his calendar. 
The reservation date and information should also be seen on the backend by the admin and the admin alone, no other user.
The user should then be able to pay for the reservation with his credit card. The user should be emailed a confirmation of this.
